What Can Steve (Think-Bot) Do?
=============================


1. Computer Vision:
   - Detects faces in the camera feed using OpenCV Haarcascade.
   - Recognizes and reads text from the camera using Tesseract OCR.
   - Detects objects in the camera feed using YOLOv5 (PyTorch).
   - Draws bounding boxes and overlays for faces, objects, and text in the OpenCV window.

2. Personality & Customization:
   - Remembers your name and preferences.
   - Can change voice or speaking style on command.

3. Extra Skills:
   - Tells jokes, gives the current time, and (optionally) weather.

4. Multilingual:
   - Detects language and can translate between languages (using Google Translate API).

5. Logging & Analytics:
   - Logs all conversations and observations for later review.

6. Modular Codebase:
   - Code is organized into modules for TTS, memory, vision, speech, Gemini AI, personality, skills, visual feedback, logging, and multilingual support.
   - Easy to extend and maintain.

2. Speech Recognition:
   - Listens for a wake word ("Steve") and responds only when addressed.
   - Converts spoken commands to text using Google Speech Recognition.

3. Conversational AI:
   - Uses Gemini AI to generate context-aware, conversational responses.
   - Maintains a conversation history for more natural interactions.

4. Text-to-Speech (TTS):
   - Speaks responses aloud using Coqui TTS (natural-sounding, non-blocking).
   - Falls back to pyttsx3 TTS if Coqui is unavailable.

5. Memory:
   - Remembers recent conversation history and observations in memory.
   - Saves and loads memory to/from a file (persistent across restarts).
   - Can recall facts or previous statements using a "recall <keyword>" command.

6. Modular Codebase:
   - Code is organized into modules for TTS, memory, vision, speech, and Gemini AI.
   - Easy to extend and maintain.

How to Interact:
----------------
- Say "Steve" to wake the bot, then give your command.
- Ask questions, request observations, or say "recall <something>" to retrieve past info.
- Steve will respond both in text and with speech.
